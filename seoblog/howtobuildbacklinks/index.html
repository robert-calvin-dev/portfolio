  <section>
    <h2>Why Backlinks Still Matter (a Lot)</h2>
    <p>Backlinks are still one of the most powerful ranking signals in Google's algorithm. But not all links are equal—and not all strategies are safe. The key to sustainable link building is relevance, authority, and intention. It’s not about blasting 10,000 emails or paying $50 for shady links. It’s about earning real connections from real sites. A single backlink from a reputable niche blog or local media site can outperform 50 low-quality directory links. The best backlinks are editorial, contextual, and deserved. That’s what this guide is about—earning your links, not faking them.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/howtobuildbacklinks.png" alt="Backlink building strategy visual" style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; border: 2px solid var(--blood-orange); max-width: 75%;">

    <h2>The Foundations: Content, Context, and Outreach</h2>
    <p>It starts with content worth linking to. This could be a tool, a guide, a statistic, a free asset, or even a case study. No one links to filler. From there, identify target sites: bloggers, journalists, SEOs, industry newsletters, business directories, and associations. Use tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, or even Google searches with operators like `inurl:resources` or `intitle:links`. Then reach out. Keep it short, human, and value-first. Show them the piece, suggest how it adds value to their readers, and don’t ask for a link—ask for a conversation. It converts better and builds long-term relationships that bring more links later.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget internal linking, either. Backlinks bring in the juice, but internal links spread it. Link new content to high-authority older posts and optimize your anchor text based on what you want to rank for. Strategic linking = better flow = better indexing.</p>

    <h3>Advanced Tactics: Guest Posts, HARO, and Link Bait</h3>
    <p>Guest posting still works—if you focus on quality and relevance. Avoid spam networks or random general-topic sites. Instead, pitch specific blogs in your niche. Write something custom, valuable, and link to your resource naturally. Another strategy: HARO (Help a Reporter Out). Sign up, respond quickly, and offer quotable insights. If your answer gets used, you often get a backlink on high-authority media sites. Also consider data-driven link bait—surveys, original research, or roundup posts that naturally attract links from others looking to cite something credible.</p>

    <p>The best backlinks aren’t transactional. They’re earned through effort, relationships, and helpfulness. And they last. Build a system for earning 1–2 great links per week, and watch your entire domain rise steadily, sustainably, and safely.</p>
