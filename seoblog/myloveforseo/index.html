  <h1 style="width: 60%; text-align: center; margin: auto;">Why I Fell in Love with SEO (and Why I’ll Never Let Go)</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>The First Time I Hit “Publish” and Watched Something Rank</h2>
    <p>It started with curiosity. A blog post about something obscure—maybe too obscure. I optimized it as best I could with what little I knew. Title. Headings. Keywords. Internal links. Then I hit publish. A week later, it ranked. Nothing flashy. Just a trickle of traffic that made me realize I could build something once... and it would keep working. That was it. I was hooked. SEO isn’t magic. It’s momentum. You build something right, and the web does the rest.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/myloveforseo.png" alt="Personal journey of SEO passion" style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; border: 2px solid var(--blood-orange); max-width: 75%;">

    <h2>It’s Technical. It’s Creative. It’s Beautiful.</h2>
    <p>SEO hits that rare sweet spot between logic and art. It’s the Venn diagram of systems thinking and storytelling. I love mapping out site structure like a puzzle—where every link, tag, and schema node serves a purpose. But I also love writing headlines that hook, building visuals that convert, and sculpting copy that says what the searcher didn’t know how to ask. SEO is the architecture of relevance. The code behind visibility. It rewards clarity, empathy, and precision. And that speaks to how I’m wired.</p>

    <p>Some days it’s debugging index issues in a robots.txt. Other days it’s building a thousand-page lead gen site with invisible long-tails. Either way, it’s fun.</p>

    <h3>Growth Without Ads. Freedom Without Dependency.</h3>
    <p>What I love most is that SEO breaks the cycle of paid gatekeepers. You don’t have to outspend—just outthink. You don’t need venture funding—just a keyboard and discipline. You can create traffic machines that live on their own, rank on their own, and grow without permission. That’s not just powerful—it’s liberating. SEO is the closest thing to digital alchemy I’ve ever found. Organic fire, built from scratch, no dependencies.</p>

    <p>And the best part? You never “finish” SEO. There’s always a new update to adapt to, a better structure to build, a tighter SERP angle to explore. It evolves. And I evolve with it.</p>
