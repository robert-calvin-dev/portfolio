  <section>
    <h2>What Keyword Research Really Means</h2>
    <p>Keyword research isn’t just a list of terms to sprinkle in your content—it’s the blueprint for understanding searcher intent, competition, and opportunity. Every keyword is a question someone is asking. Your job is to answer better than anyone else. To do that, you need to go beyond tools. Look at SERP types, content formats, and the psychology behind each query. Are they looking to buy? Learn? Compare? Navigate? Intent drives everything. When you map your keywords to your customer journey, content writes itself.</p>

    <img src="/assets/images/keywordresearch.png" alt="Keyword strategy visual with intent mapping" style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; border: 2px solid var(--blood-orange); max-width: 75%;">

    <h2>Tools That Matter (And What to Ignore)</h2>
    <p>Start with Google Search Console—your own data is gold. Then layer in Google Suggest, People Also Ask, Reddit threads, AnswerThePublic, and competitor pages. Paid tools like Ahrefs and Semrush are powerful, but they shouldn’t be your only input. Keyword difficulty, volume, and CPC are helpful, but not gospel. You’re not just looking for search volume—you’re looking for intent, weakness in the SERPs, and questions left unanswered.</p>

    <p>Create clusters around root topics. Example: for “email marketing,” you’d build clusters like “best email platforms,” “email open rate hacks,” and “email list segmentation.” This is how you scale without cannibalizing. Tools are just the spark. Strategy is the fire.</p>

    <h3>Short-Tail, Long-Tail, and Everything In Between</h3>
    <p>Short-tail keywords are competitive and broad. Long-tail keywords are specific and closer to the money. Target both—but prioritize long-tails when you're starting or entering new verticals. They convert better, rank faster, and teach you what content works. Look for queries 4+ words long, question-based searches, and modifiers like “best,” “how,” “near me,” and “for [audience].” These long-tails reveal pain points and intent.</p>

    <p>And don’t sleep on branded or competitor keywords. They can be high-converting and great for comparison posts or reviews. Just tread carefully with trademark guidelines.</p>
