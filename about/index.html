    <h1>About Robert Calvin</h1>
    <p>I didn’t come into this world with a silver spoon or a roadmap. I started from humble beginnings, shaped by the kind of experiences that make you resilient, resourceful, and deeply curious about the world around you.</p>

    <p>In my 20s, I set out to explore—literally and figuratively. I spent years immersing myself in European travel, festivals, culture, and connection. That chapter wasn’t just about escape; it was about enriching my understanding of how people experience beauty, meaning, and digital space. That foundation of observation and creativity would later shape how I approach both design and marketing.</p>

    <p>As I entered my 30s, I got serious. I wanted a career that would evolve with the world. One that wouldn’t become obsolete with the next trend or platform. So I chose the intersection of creativity and code.</p>

    <p>I started with graphic design, then leveled up into managing and fixing pre-built sites. That evolved into designing from scratch. Eventually, I dove into full web development: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, PHP—and ultimately launching fully functional sites from the ground up. My tools were simple: Visual Studio Code, GitHub Pages, and a relentless hunger to own every piece of the build.</p>

    <p>But here’s the truth: I avoided SEO at first. I found it intimidating—endless updates, technical layers, algorithm puzzles, and enough bad advice to fill a landfill. But as the projects got bigger, ignoring SEO wasn’t an option anymore. So I did what I do best—I learned, obsessively. And after five years of experimentation, refining, and real-world launches with real traffic, I now know how to build sites that rank, convert, and survive.</p>

    <p>What started as resistance became obsession. Today, I could teach a master class in SEO—because I’ve done it all: from schema markup and Core Web Vitals to dynamic page generation with Python and plugin architecture in WordPress.</p>

    <p>I’m also not afraid of the future. In fact, I’m building with it. I’ve integrated AI into my creative and technical workflows in ways that most people are just beginning to explore. My collaborations with advanced AI—like this very paragraph you’re reading—are not shortcuts, they’re accelerants. Together, we’ve built full content systems, dynamic SEO tooling, and even experimented with automated city-level page generation across thousands of locations.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just a job. This is the fusion of all my skills: creativity, structure, logic, curiosity, and a bit of rebellious energy. I’m not here to play catch-up—I’m here to build systems that lead.</p>
